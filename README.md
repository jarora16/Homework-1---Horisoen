USER STORY:
  AS A marketing agency
  I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
  SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
  
MY STORY:
  I went into the code to add alternative tags to the image sourcing
  Also added comments into the html page, so it is easier to follow and read 
  Reorganized the CSS Page so each element is grouped together 
  Also added comments into the CSS page so it is easier to follow and adjust if needed.
